<p>William Collins’ dream of knowledge for all began with the publication of his first book in 1819. A self-educated mill worker, he not only enriched millions of lives, but also founded a flourishing publishing house.</p>

<p>Collins dictionary publishing began in 1824, with the publication of a Greek Lexicon. The first Collins English dictionary, <b>Collins Senior (Etymological) Dictionary</b>, was edited throughout the 1860s and published in 1874, with various versions following in later years. This was a large-format book with engravings, and while excellent, it was relatively expensive for people to buy. William Collins’ first pioneering contribution to dictionary publishing came in 1902, with the publication of the first edition of the <b>Collins Gem Dictionary</b>. This was the world’s first small-format dictionary, and also the world’s cheapest: William Collins’ idea was to publish
a dictionary that everyone could afford. Collins Gem Dictionary soon became one of the company’s best- known – and bestselling – books, familiar to generations of dictionary users, handed down from parent (and grandparent) to child, and as popular today as it has ever been.</p>

<p>Collins remain pioneering dictionary publishers today: our dictionaries are easy to use and up to date, benefiting from extensive language research using the Collins Corpus. Constantly updated, and with over 4.5 billion words, this living language resource helps Collins track and monitor language change, allowing us to identify the new words, phrases, and meanings that spring up every day.</p>

<p>The new, 12th edition of <b>Collins English Dictionary</b> reflects this unique breadth and depth, including over 50,000 newly added words – and listing 722,000 words, meanings, and phrases in total – making this the largest single-volume English dictionary in print. All of which means that when you use a Collins Dictionary, you are one of the best-informed language users in the world.</p>
