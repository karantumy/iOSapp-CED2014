<h1>The Joy of Dictionaries</h1>
<p><b>by Mark Forsyth</b></p>

<p>There are few pastimes in life as pleasurable and profitable as reading the dictionary. The plot is, of course, rather weak, and the moral of the whole thing slightly elusive; but for my money there isn’t another book that comes close to it. In any case, all other books are simply rearrangements of this one, and partial rearrangements at that. This is the real thing, the big one from which all others derive. The French writer Anatole France was quite right when he said that a dictionary was “the universe in alphabetical order”.</p>

<p>It’s 410 years since the first English dictionary went on sale at a bookshop next to Saint Paul’s Cathedral in London. Well, I say ‘dictionary’, but it wasn’t exactly complete. It wasn’t the universe in alphabetical order. It was “<i>A table alphabeticall conteyning and teaching the true writing, and vnderstanding of hard vsuall English wordes</i>”. It only contained 2,543 entries and they were all rather weird, or “hard usual”. For a bit of comparison this dictionary contains 195,736 entry words. And just for this edition 51,000 new words have been added. Mind you, the <i>Table Alphabeticall</i> does have some great entries. There’s <i>pinguiditie</i> meaning “fatness or greasiness”; <i>excogitate</i> meaning “think through”; and there’s <i>hush</i> meaning “hush”.</p>

<p>On the minus side, the <i>Table Alphabeticall</i> claimed on its front page that the words had been “gathered for the benefit &amp; helpe of ladies, gentlewomen, or any other vnskilfull persons”, which is a pretty unchivalrous thing to say.</p>

<p>Most importantly it was the first time that an English man or woman could sit down and <i>browse</i>. The delicious pleasure of reading words that don’t have to make a sentence or a story, but are simply beautiful and interesting by themselves. Life before 1604 must have been awfully dull.</p>

<p>And the idea caught on. Everybody started writing dictionaries. Do you remember the story of Pocahontas and Captain John Smith? The great romance? Love and sorrow in a strange continent? Well, do you know what Captain John Smith did afterwards? He went back to England and wrote a dictionary: <i>THE SEAMANS Grammar and Dictionary, Explaining all the difficult TERMS in NAVIGATION</i>, which hit the bookshops in 1627. Of course, it still wasn’t complete. It was just nautical terminology like <i>a-starboard</i>, <i>breaming</i>, and <i>overmasted</i>, and therefore not that interesting a read to those who spend their time on dry land. But it did also contain the first ever references to the words <i>landfall</i>, <i>honey-combed</i>, and <i>technological</i>.</p>

<p>Dictionaries were all the rage. They even started to get comedy names. In the same year that Captain Smith’s tome came out there’s the first reference to a Richard Snary, a joke that was still being told 150 years later, and that I’ll let you work out for yourself.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until 1721, one hundred and seventeen years after the <i>Table Alphabeticall</i>, that the English language finally got a dictionary that was <i>universal</i>. In fact, it was titled the <i>Universal Etymological English Dictionary</i> and it was produced by a teacher from South London called Nathan Bailey. The <i>etymological</i> part of the title was there because this dictionary not only gave you a definition of each word, it also told you where the word had come from.</p>

<p>So the entry for <i>belch</i> reads:</p>

<quot>To BELCH [balcettan, Sax.] to break Wind upward</quot>

<p>This means that way back before the Norman Conquest, when the Anglo-Saxons roamed the earth speaking Anglo-Saxon (or Old English as it’s sometimes called), they would call upward wind-breaking <i>balcettan</i>. The Sax. is for Saxon.</p>

<p>Immediately across the page there’s:</p>

<quot>BELLIPOTENT [bellipotens, L.] mighty or powerful in War</quot>

<p>where the L. stands for Latin. The dictionary doesn’t manage to give the origin of <i>all</i> the words. <i>Bellswagger</i>, on the top right of the same page, doesn’t have any origin attached to it, just the definition: “a swaggering fellow, a hectoring Blade, a Bully”. And if you go to the column across from that you’ll find that the dictionary offers three possible origins of the word <i>Billingsgate</i>, all of which are actually wrong</p>

<p>But we should never sneer at Nathan Bailey. He may have made the occasional error and the occasional omission, but this is one guy, working on his own, holding down a day job and producing a huge dictionary. Moreover, you can see from the previous paragraphs why a dictionary is so addictive. All those words were on the same spread of two pages. And I didn’t even mention <i>behounced</i>, <i>bejaped</i>, and <i>breastings</i>.</p>

<p>The English language was still waiting, though, for a truly masterful and magisterial dictionary, one not written by an enthusiastic amateur but by a great and serious scholar. The French already had one, indeed theirs had come out in 1694, and there’s nothing that riles the English so much as to fall behind France. So in 1746 a group of publishers approached the greatest scholar of the age, Dr Samuel Johnson, and asked if he could manage something truly authoritative. Johnson said yes. How long would it take him, they asked. He replied that he could do the whole thing in three years.</p>

<p>At this point there was an awkward silence until somebody pointed out that the French dictionary that they were hoping to equal had had forty scholars – the Académie française – working on it full time for forty years. Was Johnson really claiming he could do it in three?</p>

<p>Johnson replied thus: “This is the proportion. Let me see; forty times forty is sixteen hundred. As three to sixteen hundred, so is the proportion of an Englishman to a Frenchman.”</p>

<p>He was wrong. However hubristic and patriotic you may be feeling, it turns out that three Englishmen aren’t equal to 1,600 Frenchmen. Because Johnson actually took nine years on the project, and his dictionary didn’t appear until the 15<sup>th</sup> of April 1755. So it turns out that the good doctor was merely 178 times better than a Frenchman.</p>

<p>Johnson cheated a little. He actually used an interleaved copy of Nathan Bailey’s dictionary as a roadmap for his own. But Bailey’s publishers returned the compliment by immediately nicking all Johnson’s extra research and adding it into their next edition a few months later. Bailey himself had slipped from life’s pages in 1742.</p>

<p>But Johnson’s work was magisterial, and it was shipped off to America just in time. This is important because the Americans were about to fight their War of Independence. But Johnson had essentially fixed the English language for both nations before they split apart. In fact, Johnson’s dictionary has an important place in American constitutional law. Any legal argument that goes back to the original words of the Founding Fathers has to deal with precisely what those words meant at the time. Not just our definition of them, but the definition that would have been understood by an educated man in the late eighteenth century – i.e. Dr Johnson’s definition. So he still solves legal cases from beyond the grave.</p>

<p>The Americans did get their own dictionary, though. A man called Noah Webster produced one, but such was the influence of Dr Johnson that all he could do was alter a few spellings: <i>colour</i> became <i>color</i>, <i>centre</i> became <i>center</i>, and <i>programme</i> became <i>program</i>.</p>

<p>It’s around now that dictionaries gained their great power. Dictionaries are, of course, simply records of what words usually mean and how they are usually spelled (or spelt). It doesn’t matter that the word cool originally just meant “moderately cold”, because for decades now people have been using it to describe anything really good. So this dictionary, for example, includes the definition“excellent; marvellous”. It started with teenagers, then it gets into the dictionary, and thus it gets authority.</p>

<p>Many people read the dictionary and rather than saying to themselves “So that’s how the word is usually spelled (or spelt)”, they say to themselves “That is how the word must be spelled”. Rather than saying “That’s what the word usually means”, they say “That’s what the word must mean”</p>

<p>Now, really, there’s very little difference between these two positions. Supposing somebody who really didn’t know were to tell you that they were going to a funeral and ask “What should I wear?”. You might answer“You should wear a black suit and tie” or you might answer “People usually wear a black suit and tie.” They amount to the same thing. Nobody will actually arrest you if you turn up to a funeral wearing a mint green kimono, but they may stare. You’ll stand out. But there is no clothes police. You’re free to do what you like, but most people try to fit in.</p>

<p>It’s the same with language. There are no laws. Or to spell it another way: Thair ar kno lors. There is no language police, no government department telling you how to spell <i>laws</i>. But if you spell it “lors”, people will stare. You’ll stand out. And if you write your CV like that, your job applications will receive few replies. The spellings provided in this dictionary are there to help you fit in. Language is a social thing, and in society description and prescription are one and the same.</p>

<p>So when Samuel Johnson said <i>colour</i> was spelled with a U, and Noah Webster said that it wasn’t, Britain and America listened. It was, after all, printed in a dictionary, the dictionary. And the difference survives to this day.</p>

<p>One answer to all this is to write a dictionary listing every recorded spelling of every single word, as well as all the slightly different meanings the word has had since the English language began. The only problem is that such a dictionary would get rather long and rather heavy. In fact, it runs to 18 volumes. We know this because such a dictionary exists. The Oxford English Dictionary based on “historical principles” was begun in 1857 and finally finished in 1928. And it tells you that cool has been written as <i>col</i>, <i>coul</i>, <i>cole</i>, <i>coole</i>, <i>koole</i>, <i>cuill</i>, <i>cule</i>, <i>kuil</i>, <i>cuil</i>, and … <i>cool</i>. This sort of detail has its place, especially if you’re trying to decipher a twelfth-century manuscript. But it will not help you simply write a letter without looking a bit foolish.</p>

<p>So how do you work out how a word is usually used and usually spelled? The simple solution would be to read every word written in Britain today, and listen into every single conversation. When you had noted them all down you could go through looking for uses of each word, starting with <i>Aachen</i> and ending with <i>zyzzyva</i>, and underline it with a pencil. By the time you have finished this process you will have a splendid English dictionary, but the universe will probably have come to an end.</p>

<p>But you really can do something very like this, if you use a computer, and this is where <i>Collins English Dictionary</i> comes in. When the first edition was published, back in 1979, its entries were computerized. Rather than being set out on paper, as had been the case with previous dictionaries, each entry was stored electronically and could therefore be changed quickly to keep up with a changing language. When <i>yuppies</i> and <i>glasnost</i> arrived in the 1980s, they could be inserted seamlessly into the new dictionary. When <i>rapping</i> ceased to mean simply knocking on something, and started to mean speaking rhythmically over a drumbeat, the new meaning could be added straight away. Thus Collins became the dictionary of the present.</p>

<p>Then in 1991 the Bank of English was opened for business. This was a vast, computerized collection of newspaper articles, books, recorded conversations, letters, advertisements, and so on and so forth. It contained 65 million words of normal, standard, modern English. If you published that in paperback it would be about one and a half million pages long. That’s roughly like re-reading <i>War and Peace</i> one and a half thousand times. It’s … well, it’s big. Vast. And there’s no real unit that can give a proper idea of its size, beyond saying that if you sat down to study it cover to cover, you probably wouldn’t make it through before your life was up.</p>

<p>But a computer can. A computer allows the people who put this dictionary together, using the Collins Corpus of 4.5 billion words, to see all the examples of any particular word, and see how it is usually spelled and how it is usually used. As the forty French scholars to Dr Johnson, so Dr Johnson’s nine years to modern, electronic corpus lexicography.</p>

<h3>What makes a word a word?</h3>

<p>Anybody can make up a word. In fact, I just have. <i>Flurgipp</i>. A <i>flurgipp</i> is “a random example, thought up out of thin air, to illustrate a point”. The problem is that nobody, as yet, knows that. So if I tell somebody that I had a good flurgipp this morning, I will not be understood. I can say it and write it as much as I like, but it’s of no earthly use. A word must not just be used, it must be understood.</p>

<p>Even if I explain the meaning to a couple of friends, it doesn’t take <i>flurgipp</i> very far. It becomes merely part of my idiolect. <i>Idiolect</i> was not just made up, Collins defines it as “the variety or form of a language used by an individual”. And nobody has much of an interest in a word that means something only to me and my friends. Indeed, <i>idiolect</i> is a close neighbour of <i>idioglossia</i>, “a pathological condition in which a person’s speech is so severely distorted that it is unintelligible”.</p>

<p>It’s not until <i>flurgipp</i> catches on that it becomes a proper part of the English language, and gains admittance to the hallowed halls of the dictionary. You can’t just make a word up and call it a word, or at least you can, but it’s a rather unfair way of playing Scrabble.</p>

<p>Scrabble is, perhaps, the best illustration of the relationship of dictionaries to language. A dictionary is simply a record of how language is <i>generally</i> used. But that <i>generally</i> is the vital part. I can’t just say that the word zq is a word because I just put it down on the board – Look! There it is on the triple word score! With description comes authority. But this, of course, raises the question of how much a word has to be used before it becomes a Proper Word.</p>

<p>Lewis Carroll was a great inventor of words. His poem <i>Jabberwocky</i> is famous for it:</p>

<quot>’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;</quot>

<p>Unfortunately, neither <i>brillig</i>, nor <i>slithy</i>, nor <i>toves</i>, nor <i>gimble</i>, nor <i>wabe</i> has made it into Collins. (<i>Gyre</i> is in here, but that was actually a word already; it means “to whirl”). I suppose nobody is really sure what a <i>tove</i> is, and so it never got traction. But if you read a little farther into the poem you find this:</p>

<quot>“And hast thou slain the Jabberwock? Come to my arms, my beamish boy! O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!” He chortled in his joy.</quot>

<p><i>Frabjous</i> didn’t make it, nor did “Callooh! Callay!”, but there in the last line is the first ever use of the word <i>chortle</i>. Lewis Carroll thought <i>chortle</i> up by his usual method of combining two other words – in this case <i>chuckle</i> and <i>snort</i>. He called this method the portmanteau and used it to invent <i>galumph</i> (from <i>gallop</i> and <i>triumph</i>), <i>frumious</i> (<i>fuming</i> and <i>furious</i>), and <i>chortle</i>. And for some reason <i>chortle</i> works. Of all the strange and sinister words in that poem, chortle is the one that caught on, got used, and ended up in this dictionary.</p>

<p>Portmanteaus are still being used. <i>Brunch</i> (<i>breakfast</i> and <i>lunch</i>) popped up in the 1890s, <i>smog</i> (<i>smoke</i> and <i>fog</i>) arrived in London in 1905, <i>smirting</i> (<i>smoking</i> and <i>flirting</i>) arrived with the ban on smoking in pubs and bars which forced amorous couples outside, and now we have <i>staycation</i> and <i>frape</i>, an unpleasant term that is a portmanteau of <i>Facebook</i> and <i>rape</i>. Whether these latter words will last is anybody’s guess, and <i>smirting</i> seems already to have fallen from use. But they are all used enough to have made it past the gatekeeper and into this dictionary.</p>

<p>Other words are not so lucky. Some words are widely used, but only within specific, esoteric fields. Anybody who works in the manufacture of toothpaste, for example, will know what a <i>nurdle</i> is. It’s the small bit of toothpaste that you squeeze onto your toothbrush in the morning. Those in the business need to know how many nurdles a tube contains. They usually put a picture of a single, elegant nurdle onto the packaging. If you’re in toothpaste, you know your nurdles. But very few of us are in the toothpaste business so the nurdle of toothpaste is not in this dictionary. It is, after all, unlikely to pop up in a novel or newspaper article.</p>

<p>However, cricket is popular enough to qualify and cricket has its own <i>nurdle</i>, with a completely different meaning. To nurdle a ball is to deflect it – rather than hit it – and thus score a few runs. So <i>nurdle</i> the dental noun may not have made it in, but <i>nurdle</i> the sporting verb has.</p>

<p>Words that are only ever used by people in specific industries or strange academic fields are confined to specialist dictionaries; Collins is for everyday use.</p>

<p>So how does a word get itself used? Some words, like chortle, are perennially useful. Others are made useful by history. <i>E-mail</i>, <i>spam</i>, <i>troll</i>, <i>browser</i>, <i>frape</i>: all of these words have, of course, appeared since the invention of the internet. Or at least, they have in their current meanings. <i>Browser</i> was around before, but it meant something that browses, like a cow. <i>Trolling</i> was a form of fishing where you simply trailed some bait on the end of a line behind your boat. <i>Spam</i> was a kind of tinned food. And <i>email</i> was a kind of pottery design current in France in the nineteenth century. Admittedly that <i>email</i> was a variant of <i>enamel</i> and nothing to do with <i>electronic mail</i>, but it’s nice to know that there was once such a thing as <i>email ink</i>.</p>

<p>You could write a history of the world just by looking at the words that got into the dictionary, and disappeared from it. You would of course have your great scientific advances: <i>oxygen</i>, <i>aeroplane</i>, <i>penicillin</i>, and <i>boob job</i>. But politics would play its part, for it was the world of politics that gave us <i>Cold War</i>, <i>glasnost</i>, <i>ayatollah</i>, and <i>suicide bomber</i>. <i>Social security</i> is defined in this dictionary as “public provision for the economic, and sometimes social, welfare of the aged, unemployed, etc, esp through pensions and other monetary assistance”, but it would once have meant being sure that your friends liked you.</p>

<p>New habits make themselves known through phrases like <i>sofa-surfing</i> and <i>texting</i>. And art and music can be seen with the arrival of <i>impressionism</i>, <i>ragtime</i>, <i>heavy metal</i>, <i>hip-hop</i>, and <i>emo</i>. New social types arrive. Before the 1980s there was no such thing as a <i>Sloane Ranger</i> or a <i>yuppie</i> (from “Young Urban Professional”). And the 1990s gave us <i>Britpop</i> and <i>ethnic cleansing</i>.</p>

<p>Sometimes these words merely involve a new label applied to something that already exists. The <i>teenager</i> was never heard of before 1942. This doesn’t mean that the ages thirteen to nineteen didn’t exist before then. It was merely that they weren’t considered that important. You were a child and then you were a young man or woman. You played with toys, then you put those toys away and got yourself a job. The teenage phenomenon could only start when the teenagers were separated out by language. They were given a name and with it they were given an identity and very soon they were able to listen to teenage music, dress in teenage fashions, and do teenage things like dancing and sulking.</p>

<p>And with the rise of computers we have had the rise of the geek. <i>Geek</i> was originally a Scots dialect word (<i>geck</i>) that meant a fool or a simpleton. But slowly it became an insult, a term for an unsociable and boring student. And from there it has been reclaimed as a badge of honour for anybody who really understands computers and their strange ways. Now we have <i>geek</i>, <i>geeky</i>, and <i>geekspeak</i>, and this edition introduces <i>geekery</i>, <i>geekism</i>, and <i>geek chic</i>: “a fashion style believed to be characteristic of geeks, including the wearing of heavy-rimmed glasses and T-shirts with humorous slogans”. The fool has become fashionable. But it’s worthwhile remembering that for a brief period in its career, at the beginning of the twentieth century, <i>geek</i> was American slang for a circus performer who bit the heads off toads.</p>

<h3>What’s new?</h3>

<p>This dictionary contains 51,000 entries that have never appeared before. That’s the largest number that has ever been added to a new edition of Collins. As you can, no doubt, imagine, there are much too many to give a full and detailed account of everything that’s gone in, and why. We can leave that task to some future scholar who will pore over it all from his future study trying to work out what on earth went on in 2014. It’s too much for any one person even to remember them all. The days of Dr Johnson have long since passed. And dictionaries are the better for that.</p>

<p>Some new words have been included for reasons that are prosaically obvious. The <i>olinguito</i> is a kind of racoon that lives in the cloud forests of the Andes. It crawls around among the foggy branches, and only does so at night, which probably explains why it was not discovered until 2013. And a year later it has crawled into the dictionary. The same thing goes for the <i>lesula</i>, a species of monkey found only in a small part of the Congo, which managed to go undiscovered for centuries despite having a strangely human face slightly resembling Edith Sitwell, and bright blue buttocks.</p>

<p>Other new additions are technological. Indeed, this is the first time that the word <i>technophilia</i> –“enthusiasm for technology and the latest technological devices” – has appeared. It’s a close neighbour of <i>textonym</i> – a word that can be generated using the same numbers on a keypad – and <i>Twittersphere</i>.</p>

<p>Society takes its sorry place beside technology. We have, for the first time, the practice of <i>preloading</i>, which means drinking before you go out for the evening. Thus getting yourself drunk enough that you need not pay the exorbitant prices charged in a nightclub. Except that you aren’t necessarily drunk anymore. With this dictionary it is quite possible to preload until you are <i>blootered</i>. Either way, you’ll probably end up <i>twerking</i>.</p>

<p>Not all of the new words in this dictionary, though, are new. Some are old words which have been excluded for too long. Beautiful old words like <i>slumbersome</i>, which is a much better way of saying “sleepy”. It’s those soft, soothing S’s that send you off to <i>slumberland</i>, another new-old word that means “the domain of sleep”. Some of these are charming and elegant like the <i>raconteuse</i>, or “female raconteur”. Or perhaps <i>eyesome</i>, which means “pleasing to the eye”. Both demonstrate <i>facundity</i>, an old term for “the quality of eloquence”.</p>

<p>And other words are almost comical in their inelegance. Sitting glumly in the corner is <i>quonk</i>, which is a broadcasting term for any noise accidentally picked up on a microphone. There’s something so awkward and dumpy about the sound of <i>quonk</i> that it fits perfectly into its role. There’s the <i>noop</i>, which is the very tip of the elbow; and there’s the <i>haffet</i>, which is a part of the face in front of and above the ear.</p>

<p>A page or so further on and you get the horrors of the <i>hagrider</i>, which is a person or thing that causes fear and apprehension. The only cure for this is to <i>halse</i>, which is “to hug or embrace”. I could blather on through all 50,000-plus additions, but for the moment, let us stick to the simple, newly included phrase <i>nuff</i> said.</p>

<h3>Why read dictionaries?</h3>

<p>We all, at times, read the dictionary. It is a dry and incurious soul who has never looked up an unfamiliar word, just to find its meaning, and then let their eye wander across the columns. This is the great trick, the great seduction of the dictionary. It lures you in with the promise of a quick, simple answer. But then, like a wily shopkeeper, it keeps offering you more and more. You opened the dictionary because you wanted to know what <i>agnate</i> meant. You are told in a quick and efficient manner that <i>agnate</i> means “related by descent from a common male ancestor”, but already your eye is on <i>aglet</i>, and you’re saying to yourself “There’s a word! A single word for the little plastic bit on the end of a shoelace”. Then it’s down to <i>agnoiology</i>, the philosophical theory of ignorance. And, before you know it, the day is over, it’s bedtime, and you will dream of <i>aggressive agnathans aglimmer at Agincourt</i>.</p>

<p>And even with words so familiar that you thought them boring, the etymologies surprise and delight. Nathan Bailey’s great innovation is continued in Collins. You find that a <i>guerrilla</i> is Spanish for a “little war”, that <i>cappuccinos</i> are named after Capuchin monks, or that <i>Avalon</i> means <i>apple</i> in Welsh. Sometimes these etymologies are beautifully simple. You find that a <i>fan</i> – as in a football fan – is simply a shortening of <i>fanatic</i> and you nod your head and say to yourself, that all makes perfect sense now. At other times, your jaw drops, as when you discover that <i>avocado</i> comes from the Aztec word for <i>testicle</i>, “alluding to the shape of the fruit”. It is at moments such as this that you realize you will never be able to look at a greengrocers in the same way, even though you now know that a <i>grocer</i> is somebody who buys his food in <i>gross</i>.</p>

<p>Each word has a story, however familiar and dull you may have thought it all your life. It’s like discovering the surprising criminal record of a work colleague. All the connections and contortions of the English language are mapped out and recorded.</p>

<p>And there are the strange new words, the words that you never knew, names for the unnamed. The groove that runs from your nose down to your lips, is as familiar as … well, as your own face. But to be able to call it the <i>philtrum</i>, to know the name is everything. Naming is power, even God knows this, which is why nobody is allowed to say the secret name of God, <i>YHWH</i>, aloud, and either way nobody is certain on how to pronounce it. But without any such blasphemy we can finally know that that funny backwards P used to mark paragraphs – the mysterious ¶ – is called a <i>pilcrow</i>. Or that the innermost rooms of a building are called the <i>penetralia</i>. Or that seeing shapes in the clouds is <i>pareidolia</i>. In fact, pareidolia involves seeing a pattern anywhere where there isn’t one, whether it’s thinking that the windows and door of a house look like the eyes and mouth of a human face, or finding significance in statistics, or secret codes in Shakespeare. All pareidolia, all nameable.</p>

<p>Or there’s the smell, the beautiful smell, that rises from the earth when it rains after a long dry spell. It’s a scent of summer, of refreshing rains, and there is a word for it among the new additions in this edition. It is <i>petrichor</i>. So now you know.</p>

<p>And all those are only in the Ps. Yet these words can be found on every page of the dictionary, from <i>abecedarian</i> (arranged in alphabetical order) through to <i>zugzwang</i> (a situation in which anything you do will make matters worse).</p>

<p>Each reading of the dictionary is different. Each time you start in a new place on a new word that you just wanted to know the meaning of, and each time your eye moves in a different direction through all the myriad possibilities. W.H. Auden once said:</p>

<quot>For a desert island, one would choose a good dictionary rather than the greatest literary masterpiece imaginable, for, in relation to its readers, a dictionary is absolutely passive and may legitimately be read in an infinite number of ways.</quot>

<p>A novel or a poem must be read only one way: from beginning to end. You are marched in at chapter one and then sternly guided through to the last line. But the dictionary has no beginning and no end. You can read it in any way you wish. You can read it for edification or for amusement. You can have great fun just by looking at the headwords on each page: <xrhw>empiric</xrhw> to <xrhw>emu</xrhw>, <xrhw>Jeevesian</xrhw> to <xrhw>jeopardy</xrhw>, <xrhw>filth</xrhw> to <xrhw>finance</xrhw>. Sometimes the pairings seem ridiculous, sometimes appropriate – as with <xrhw>bandito</xrhw> to <xrhw>bank</xrhw> – and sometimes frighteningly controversial – <xrhw>genesis</xrhw> to <xrhw>genizah</xrhw>, a place to dispose of worn-out biblical texts. And sometimes … well sometimes the alphabet deals you <xrhw>ballocks</xrhw> to <xrhw>balsam</xrhw>, and there’s nothing you can do about it. Only in the infinitely variable dictionary can all these possibilities be found. Begin anywhere, end anywhere, and take any journey between.</p>

<p>Auden wasn’t the only poet who read dictionaries. Emily Dickinson wrote in her letters that for years her dictionary was her “only companion”. In long solitary studies she riffled through her lexicon taking words in, rearranging them, and turning them out again as beautiful, perfect poems. Words in: words out. Every book ever written is merely a partial rearrangement of this one. As Jean Cocteau put it, “The greatest masterpiece in literature is only a dictionary out of order.” Here are all the possibilities and all the pleasures of language set out on paper, although perhaps the American comedian Steven Wright put it best: “I was reading the dictionary, I thought it was a poem about everything.”</p>
