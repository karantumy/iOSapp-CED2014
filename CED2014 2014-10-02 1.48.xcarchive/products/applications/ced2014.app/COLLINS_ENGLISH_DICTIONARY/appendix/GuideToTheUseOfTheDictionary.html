<h1>Guide to the Use of the Dictionary</h1>

<p>The Guide that follows sets out the main principles on which the dictionary is arranged and enables you to make full use of the dictionary by showing the range of information that it contains.</p>

<h2 id="Headword">Headword</h2>

<p>All main entries, including place names, abbreviations, prefixes, and suffixes, are printed in large bold type and are listed in strict alphabetical order. This applies even if the headword consists of more than one word.</p>

<p>Some main entries contain subentries, in alphabetical order within the main entry. These subentry headwords are closely related to the main entry headword, usually in that they are compounds (eg <xrhw>bandstand</xrhw> at <xrhw>band</xrhw>)
or derivatives (eg <xrhw>abhorrent</xrhw> at <xrhw>abhor</xrhw>) of that word. However, where the editors have judged that such a word would be too difficult to find as a subentry, the word will be found as a separate, main entry.</p>

<h3>Order of entries</h3>

<p>Words with superscript numbers after the headwords are homographs – they have the same spelling but are derived from different sources.</p>

<entry><hw>saw<sup>1</sup></hw> (<pron>sɔw</pron>) <posp>n</posp> <sense-num>1</sense-num> <def>any of various hand tools...</def></entry>
<entry><hw>saw<sup>2</sup></hw> (<pron>sɔw</pron>) <posp>vb</posp> <def>the past tense of <xrhw>see<sup>1</xrhw></sup></def></entry>
<entry><hw>saw<sup>3</sup></hw> (<pron>sɔw</pron>) <posp>n</posp> a wise saying, maxim, or proverb...</entry>

<p>A word with a capital initial letter, if entered separately, follows the lowercase form. For example, <xrhw>Arras follows</xrhw> <xrhw>arras</xrhw>.</p>

<h3>Place names</h3>

<p>If a place has more than one name, its main entry is given at the name most often used in modern English, with a cross-reference at other names. Thus, the main entry for the capital of Bavaria is at <xrhw>Munich</xrhw>, with a cross-reference at <xrhw>München</xrhw>. If a place name has no current anglicized form, its main entry is at the form of the name used in the official language of the area. Thus, the main entry is at <xrhw>Brno</xrhw>, with a cross-reference at <xrhw>Brünn</xrhw>. Historical names of importance are also given, with dates where these can be ascertained.</p>

<entry><hw>Paris<sup>1</sup></hw> (<pron>ˈpæris</pron>; French pari) <posp>n</posp> <def>...Ancientname: Lutetia</def></entry>
<entry><hw>Volgograd</hw> (Russian <pron>vəlɡaˈɡrat</pron>; English <pron>vɒlɡəυɡræd</pron>) <posp>n</posp> <def>... Former names: (until 1925) Tsaritsyn, (1925–61) Stalingrad</def></entry>

<p>Statistical information about places has been obtained from the most up-to-date and reliable sources available. Population figures are derived from the most recent census available, the date of which is always given.</p>

<h3>Abbreviations, acronyms, and symbols</h3>

<p>Abbreviations, acronyms, and symbols are entered as headwords in the main alphabetical list. In line with modern practice, full stops are generally not used but it can be assumed that nearly all abbreviations are equally acceptable with or without stops.</p>

<p>Alphanumeric representations of words such as those now commonly used in electronic communication – <xrhw>GR8</xrhw> (great), <xrhw>B4</xrhw> (before), etc – are ordered such that the numeral is not regarded as representing a letter or a word. Instead, such entries are ordered like other alphanumeric abbreviations, for example <xrhw>G8</xrhw> (Group of Eight) and <xrhw>K2</xrhw> (the mountain).</p>

<entry><hw>gr</hw></entry>
<entry><hw>GR</hw></entry>
<entry><hw>Gr.</hw></entry>
<entry><hw>GR8</hw></entry>
<entry><hw>Graafian follicle</hw></entry>

<p>This rule, however, does not apply to the small number of alphanumeric representations of words that start with a numeral. In such cases the numeral is spelled out as the letter or series of letters that it represents.</p>

<entry><hw>foretriangle</hw></entry>
<entry><hw>4EVA</hw></entry>
<entry><hw>forever</hw></entry>

<h3>Prefixes, suffixes, and combining forms</h3>

<p>Prefixes (eg <xrhw>in-</xrhw>, <xrhw>pre-</xrhw>, <xrhw>sub-</xrhw>), suffixes (eg <xrhw>-able</xrhw>, <xrhw>-ation</xrhw>, <xrhw>-ity</xrhw>), and combining forms (eg <xrhw>psycho-</xrhw>, <xrhw>-iatry</xrhw>) have been entered as headwords if they are still used freely to produce new words in English.</p>

<h3>Plural headwords</h3>

<p>Words that have a standard use or uses in the plural may be entered as separate headwords at both singular and plural forms, with a cross-reference to the plural form at the singular entry if other headwords intervene.</p>

<entry><hw>affair</hw> (<pron>əˈfεə</pron>) <posp>n</posp> <sense-num>1</sense-num> <def>a thing to be done or attended to ... ∂ See also affairs</def></entry>
<entry><hw>affairs</hw> (<pron>əˈfεəz</pron>) <lb>pl</lb> <posp>n</posp> <sense-num>1</sense-num> <def>personal or business interests ...</def></entry>

<h3>Variant spellings</h3>
<p>Common acceptable variant spellings of English words are given as alternative forms of the headword.</p>

<entry><hw>capitalize</hw> or <hw>capitalise</hw> (<pron>ˈkæpitəˌlaiz</pron>) <posp>vb</posp> <def>...</def></entry>

<h3>US spellings</h3>

<p>Where different, US spellings are also recorded in the headword.</p>

<entry><hw>centre</hw> or <lb>US</lb> <hw>center</hw> (<pron>ˈsεntə</pron>) <posp>n</posp> <def>...</def></entry>

<h2 id="Pronunciations">Pronunciations</h2>

<p>Pronunciations of words in this dictionary represent those that are common in Standard English. They are transcribed in the International Phonetic Alphabet (ipa). A <i>Pronunciation Key</i> is printed at the end of this Guide. The pronunciation is normally given in brackets immediately after the headword.</p>

<entry><hw>abase</hw> (<pron>əˈbeis</pron>) <posp>vb</posp> (<lb>tr</lb>) <sense-num>1</sense-num> <def>to humble ...</def></entry>

<p>The stress pattern is marked by the symbols ˈ for primary stress and ˌ for secondary stress. The stress mark precedes the syllable to which it applies.</p>

<h3>Variant pronunciations</h3>

<p>When a headword has an acceptable variant pronunciation or stress pattern, the variant is given by repeating only the syllable or syllables that change.</p>

<entry><hw>economic</hw> (<pron>ˌiwkəˈnɒmIk</pron>, <pron>ˌεkə-</pron>) <posp>adj</posp> <sense-num>1</sense-num> <def>of or relating to ...</def></entry>

<h3>Pronunciations with different parts of speech</h3>

<p>When two or more parts of speech of a word have different pronunciations, the pronunciations are shown in brackets before the relevant group of senses.</p>

<entry><hw>record</hw> <posp>n</posp> (<pron>ˈrεkɔwd</pron>) <sense-num>1</sense-num> <def>an account in permanent form...</def> <posp>vb</posp> (<pron>rIˈkɔwd</pron>) (<lb>mainly tr</lb>) <sense-num>19</sense-num> <def>to set down in some permanent form ...</def></entry>

<h3>Pronunciation of individual senses</h3>

<p>If one sense of a headword is pronounced differently from the other senses, the pronunciation is given in brackets after the sense number.</p>

<entry><hw>conjure</hw> (<pron>ˈkʌndʒə</pron>) <posp>vb</posp> <sense-num>1</sense-num> (<lb>intr</lb>) <def>to practise conjuring or be a conjuror</def> <sense-num>2</sense-num> (<lb>intr</lb>) <def>to call upon supposed supernatural forces by spells and incantations</def>
<sense-num>3</sense-num> (<pron>kənˈdʒυə</pron>) (<lb>tr</lb>) <def>to appeal earnestly or strongly to: <exmpl>I conjure you to help me</exmpl></def></entry>

<h3>Foreign words and phrases</h3>

<p>Foreign words or phrases are printed in bold italic type and are given foreign-language pronunciations only, unless they are regarded as having become accepted into English.</p>

<entry><hw>Weltschmerz</hw> <lb>German</lb> (<pron>ˈvεltʃmεrts</pron>) <posp>n</posp> <def>...</def></entry>

<h2 id="Inflected forms">Inflected forms</h2>

<p>Where inflections are not shown, it may be assumed that they are formed as follows:</p>

<p><posp>nouns</posp> regular plurals are formed by the addition of-s (egpencils, monkeys) or, in the case of nouns ending in -s, -x, -z, -ch, or -sh, by the addition of -es (eg losses).</p>

<p><posp>verbs</posp> inregular inflected verbs:the third persons ingular of the present tense is formed by the addition of -s to the infinitive (eg plays) or, for verbs ending in -s, -x, -z, -ch, or -sh, by the addition of -es (eg passes, reaches); the past tense and past participle are formed by the addition of -ed to the infinitive (eg played); the present participle is formed by the addition of -ing to the infinitive (eg playing). Verbs that end in a consonant plus -e (eg locate, snare) regularly lose the final -e before the addition of -ed and -ing.</p>

<p><posp>adjectives</posp> regular comparatives and superlatives of adjectives are formed by adding -er and -est to the base (eg short, shorter, shortest). Adjectives that end in a consonant plus -e regularly lose the -e before -er and -est (eg fine, finer, finest).</p>

<h2 id="posp">Parts of Speech</h2>

<p>A part-of-speech label in italics precedes the sense or senses relating to that part of speech.</p>

<h3>Standard parts of speech</h3>

<p>The standard parts of speech, with the abbreviations used, are as follows: adjective (<posp>adj</posp>), adverb (<posp>adv</posp>), conjunction (<posp>conj</posp>), interjection (<posp>interj</posp>), noun (<posp>n</posp>), preposition (<posp>prep</posp>), pronoun (<posp>pron</posp>), verb (<posp>vb</posp>).</p>

<h3>Less traditional parts of speech</h3>

<p>Some less traditional parts of speech have been used in this dictionary:</p>

<p><posp>determiner</posp> this denotes such words as the, <i>a</i>, <i>some</i>, <i>any</i>, <i>that</i>, <i>this</i>, as well as the numerals, and possessives such as <i>my</i> and <i>your</i>. Many determiners can have a pronoun function without a change of meaning:</p>

<entry><hw>some</hw> (<pron>sʌm</pron>; unstressed <pron>səm</pron>) <posp>determiner</posp> ... <sense-num>2</sense-num> <sense-num>a</sense-num> <def>an unknown or unspecified quantity or amount of: <i>there’s some rice on the table</i>; he owns some horses <sense-num>b</sense-num> (<i>as pronoun; functioning as sing or plural</i>): we’ll buy some ...</def></entry>

<p><posp>sentence connector</posp> this description replaces the traditional classification of certain words, such as <i>therefore</i> and <i>however</i>, as adverbs or conjunctions. These words link sentences together rather in the manner of conjunctions; however, they are not confined to the first position in a clause as conjunctions are.</p>

<p><posp>sentence substitute</posp> these are words such as <i>yes</i>, <i>no</i>, <i>perhaps</i>, <i>definitely</i>, and <i>maybe</i>. They can stand alone as meaningful utterances.</p>

<!--
<h3>Words used as more than one part of speech</h3>

<p>If a word can be used as more than one part of speech, the senses of one part of speech are separated from the others by an empty arrow (▷)</p>

<entry><hw>lure</hw> (<pron>lυə</pron>) <posp>vb</posp> (<lb>tr</lb>) <def>...</def> <sense-num>2</sense-num> <def>falconry to entice (a hawk or falcon) from the air to the falconer by a lure</def> ▷ <posp>n</posp> <sense-num>3</sense-num> <def>a person or thing that lures ...</def></entry>
-->

<h2 id="Grammatical information">Grammatical information</h2>

<p>Grammatical information is provided in brackets and typically in italics to distinguish it from other types of information.</p>

<h3>Adjectives and determiners</h3>

<p>Some adjectives and determiners are restricted by usage to a particular position relative to the nouns they qualify. This is indicated by the following labels:</p>

<p><posp>postpositive</posp> (used predicatively or after the noun, but not before it):</p>

<entry><hw>ablaze</hw> (<pron>əˈbleIz</pron>) <posp>adj</posp>, <posp>adv</posp> (<lb>postpositive</lb>) <sense-num>1</sense-num> <def>on fire; burning ...</def></entry>

<p><posp>immediately postpositive</posp> (always used immediately following the noun qualified and never used predicatively):</p>

<entry><hw>galore</hw> (<pron>ɡəˈlɔw</pron>) <posp>determiner</posp> (<lb>immediately postpositive</lb>) <def>in great numbers or quantity: <exmpl>there were daffodils galore in the park</exmpl> ...</def></entry>

<p><posp>prenominal</posp> (used before the noun, and never used predicatively):</p>

<entry><hw>chief</hw> (<pron>tʃiwf</pron>) ... <posp>adj</posp> <sense-num>5</sense-num> (<i>prenominal</i>) <def>a most important;
principal ...</def></entry>

<h3>Intensifiers</h3>

<p>Adjectives and adverbs that perform an exclusively intensifying function, with no addition of meaning, are described as (intensifier) without further explanation.</p>

<entry><hw>blooming</hw> (<pron>ˈbluwmIŋ</pron>) <posp>adv</posp>, <posp>adj</posp> <lb>Brit informal</lb> (intensifier): <def><i>a blooming genius</i>; <i>blooming painful</i></def></entry>

<h3>Conjunctions</h3>

<p>Conjunctions are divided into two classes, marked by the following labels:</p>

<p><posp>coordinating</posp> coordinating conjunctions connect words, phrases, or clauses that perform an identical function and are not dependent on each other. They include and, <i>but</i>, and <i>or</i>.</p>

<p><posp>subordinating</posp> subordinating conjunctions introduce clauses that are dependent on a main clause in a complex sentence. They include <i>where</i>, <i>until</i>, and <i>if</i>.</p>

<p>Some conjunctions, such as <i>while</i> and <i>whereas</i>, can function as either coordinating or subordinating conjunctions.</p>

<h3>Singular and plural labelling of nouns</h3>

<p>Headwords and senses that are apparently plural in form but that take a singular verb, etc, are marked (<i>functioning as sing</i>):</p>

<entry><hw>physics</hw> (<pron>ˈfIzIks</pron>) <posp>n</posp> (functioning as sing) <sense-num>1</sense-num> <def>the branch of science ...</def></entry>

<p>Headwords and senses that appear to be singular, such as collective nouns, but that take a plural verb, etc, are marked (<i>functioning as plural</i>):</p>

<entry><hw>cattle</hw> (<pron>ˈkætəl</pron>) <posp>n</posp> (<lb>functioning as plural</lb>) <sense-num>1</sense-num> <def>bovid mammals of the tribe Bovini ...</def></entry>

<p>Headwords and senses that may take either a singular or a plural verb, etc, are marked (<i>functioning as sing or plural</i>):</p>

<entry><hw>bellows</hw> (<pron>bεləυz</pron>) <posp>n</posp> (<lb>functioning as sing or plural</lb>) <sense-num>1</sense-num> <i>Also called:</i> <xrhw>pair of bellows</xrhw> <def>an instrument consisting of an air chamber ...</def></entry>

<h3>Modifiers</h3>

<p>A noun that is commonly used as if it were an adjective is labelled <lb>modifier</lb>. If the sense of the modifier can be understood from the sense of the noun, the modifier is shown without further explanation, with an example to illustrate its use. Otherwise its meaning and/or usage is explained separately.</p>

<entry><hw>horror</hw> (<pron>ˈhɒrə</pron>) <posp>n</posp> ... <sense-num>4</sense-num> (<lb>modifier</lb>) <def>having a frightening subject, esp a supernatural one: <exmpl>a horror film</exmpl></def></p>

<h3>Verbs</h3>

<p>The principal parts given are: 3rd person singular of the present tense; present participle; past tense; past participle (if different from the past tense).</p>

<h3 id="lbgramdesc">Intransitive and transitive verbs</h3>

<p>When a sense of a verb (<posp>vb</posp>) is restricted to transitive use, it is labelled (<lb>tr</lb>); if it is intransitive only, it is labelled (<lb>intr</lb>). If all the senses of a verb are transitive or all are intransitive, the appropriate label appears before the first numbered sense and is not repeated.</p>

<p>Absence of a label is significant: it indicates that the sense may be used both transitively and intransitively.</p>

<p>If nearly all the senses of a verb are transitive, the label (<lb>mainly
tr</lb>) appears immediately before the first numbered sense. This indicates that, unless otherwise labelled, any given sense of the verb is transitive. Similarly, all the senses of a verb may be labelled (<lb>mainly intr</lb>).</p>

<h3>Copulas</h3>

<p>A verb that takes a complement is labelled (copula).</p>

<entry><hw>seem</hw> (<pron>siːm</pron>) <posp>vb</posp> (may take an infinitive) <sense-num>1</sense-num> (<lb>copula</lb>) <def>to appear to the mind or eye; look: <exmpl>this seems nice</exmpl>; <exmpl>the car seems to be running well</exmpl> ...</def></entry>

<h3>Phrasal verbs</h3>

<p>Verbal constructions consisting of a verb and a prepositional or an adverbial particle are given headword status if the meaning of the phrasal verb cannot be deduced from the separate meanings of the verb and the particle.</p>

<p>Phrasal verbs are labelled to show four possible distinctions:</p>

<p>a transitive verb with an adverbial particle (<lb>tr</lb>, <lb>adverb</lb>); a transitive verb with a prepositional particle (<lb>tr</lb>, <lb>preposition</lb>); an intransitive verb with an adverbial particle (<lb>intr</lb>, <lb>adverb</lb>); an intransitive verb with a prepositional particle (<lb>intr</lb>, <lb>preposition</lb>):</p>

<entry><hw>turn on</hw> ... <sense-num>4</sense-num> (<lb>tr</lb>, <lb>adverb</lb>) <def>informal to produce (charm, tears, etc) suddenly or automatically</def></entry>

<entry><hw>take for</hw> <posp>vb</posp> (<lb>tr</lb>, <lb>preposition</lb>) <def>informal to consider or suppose to be, esp mistakenly: <exmpl>the fake coins were taken for genuine</exmpl>; <exmpl>who do you take me for?</exmpl></def></entry>

<entry><hw>break off</hw> ... <sense-num>3</sense-num> (<lb>intr</lb>, <lb>adverb</lb>) <def>to stop abruptly: <exmpl>he broke off in the middle of his speech</exmpl></def></entry>

<entry><hw>turn on</hw> ... <sense-num>2</sense-num> (<lb>intr</lb>, <lb>preposition</lb>) <def>to depend or hinge on: <exmpl>the success of the party turns on you</exmpl></def></entry>

<p>If there is no label (<lb>tr</lb>) or (<lb>intr</lb>), the verb may be used either transitively or intransitively. If there is no label (<lb>adverb</lb>) or (<lb>preposition</lb>), the particle may be either adverbial or prepositional.</p>

<h2 id="Restrictive labels">Restrictive labels</h2>

<p>An italic label immediately before a definition indicates that a particular sense is restricted as to appropriateness, connotation, subject field, etc:</p>

<entry><hw>hang on</hw> <posp>vb</posp> (<lb>intr</lb>) ... <sense-num>5</sense-num> (<lb>adverb</lb>) <def>informal to wait or remain: <exmpl>hang on for a few minutes</exmpl></def></entry>

<p>If a label applies to all senses of one part of speech, it is placed immediately after the part-of-speech label.</p>

<entry><hw>assured</hw> (<pron>əˈʃʊəd</pron>) <posp>adj</posp> ... <posp>n</posp> <sense-num>4</sense-num> <def>chiefly Brit a the beneficiary under a life assurance policy b the person whose life is insured ...</def></entry>

<p>If a label applies to all senses of a headword, it is placed immediately after the pronunciation (or inflections).</p>

<entry><hw>con<sup>1</sup></hw> (<pron>kɒn</pron>) <lb>informal</lb> <posp>n</posp> <sense-num>1</sense-num> <sense-num>a</sense-num> <def>short for confidence trick</def> <sense-num>b</sense-num> (<lb>as modifier</lb>): <lb>conman</lb> <posp>vb</posp> <def><xrhw>cons</xrhw>, <xrhw>conning</xrhw>, <xrhw>conned</xrhw></def><br/><sense-num>2</sense-num> (<lb>tr</lb>) <def>to swindle or defraud</def></entry>

<h3 id="lbregister">Usage labels</h3>

<p><lb>slang</lb> refers to words or senses that are informal and restricted in context, for example, to members of a particular social or cultural group. Slang words are inappropriate in formal speech or writing.</p>

<p><lb>informal</lb> applies to words or senses that maybe widely used, especially in conversation, letter-writing, etc, but that are not common in formal writing. Such words are subject to fewer contextual restrictions than slang words.</p>

<p><lb>taboo</lb> indicates words that are not acceptable in polite use.</p>

<p><lb>offensive</lb> indicates that a word might be regarded as offensive by the person described or referred to, even if the speaker uses the word without any malicious intention.</p>

<p><lb>derogatory</lb> implies that the connotations of a word are unpleasant with intent on the part of the speaker or writer.</p>

<p><lb>not standard</lb> indicates words or senses that are frequently encountered but widely regarded as incorrect.</p>

<p><lb>archaic</lb> denotes a word or sense that is no longer incommon use but that may be found in literary works or used to impart a historical colour to contemporary writing.</p>

<p><lb>obsolete</lb> denotes a word or sense that is no longer in use. In specialist or technical fields the label often implies that the term has been superseded.</p>

<p>The word ‘formerly’ is placed in brackets before a sense when the practice, concept, etc, being described, rather than the word itself, is obsolete or out of date.</p>

<p>A number of other usage labels, such as <lb>ironic</lb>, <lb>facetious</lb>, and <lb>euphemistic</lb>, are used where appropriate. Further help on usage is provided in usage notes after certain entries.</p>

<h3 id="lbsubjfld">Subject-field labels</h3>

<p>A number of italic labels are used to indicate that a word or sense is used in a particular specialist or technical field.</p>

<h3 id="lbgeo">National and regional labels</h3>

<p>Words or senses restricted to or associated with a particular country or region are labelled accordingly. The following labels are the ones most frequently used: <lb>Austral</lb> (Australian), <lb>Brit</lb> (British), <lb>Canadian</lb>, <lb>Caribbean</lb>, <lb>Irish</lb>, <lb>NZ</lb> (New Zealand), <lb>Scot</lb> (Scottish), <lb>South African</lb>, <lb>US</lb> (United States).</p>

<p>The label <lb>Brit</lb> is used mainly to distinguish a particular word or sense from its North American equivalent or to identify a term or concept that does not exist in North American English. The North American equivalent may be given in bold type after the appropriate numbered sense.</p>

<p>Regional dialects (<lb>Scot and Northern English dialect</lb>, <lb>Midland dialect</lb>, etc) have been specified as precisely as possible, even at the risk of overrestriction, in order to give the reader an indication of the appropriate regional flavour.</p>

<h2 id="Meaning">Meaning</h2>

<p>The meaning of each headword in this dictionary is explained in one or more definitions, together with information about context and typical use.</p>

<h3>Order of senses</h3>

<p>As a general rule, where a headword has more than one sense, the first sense given is the one most common in current usage.</p>

<entry><hw>complexion</hw> (<pron>kəmˈplɛkʃən</pron>) <posp>n</posp> <sense-num>1</sense-num> <def>the colour and general appearance of a person’s skin, esp of the face</def> <sense-num>2</sense-num> <def>aspect, character, or nature: <exmpl>the general complexion of anation’s finances</exmpl></def> <sense-num>3</sense-num> <def>obsolete athe temperament of a person ...</def></entry>

<p>Where the lexicographers consider that a current sense is the ‘core meaning’, in that it illuminates the meaning of other senses, the core meaning may be placed first.</p>

<p>Subsequent senses are arranged so as to give a coherent account
of the meaning of a headword. If a word is used as more than one part of speech, all the senses of each part of speech are grouped together in a single block. Within a part-of-speech block, closely related senses are grouped together; technical senses usually follow general senses; archaic and obsolete senses follow technical senses; idioms and fixed phrases are generally placed last.</p>

<h3>Scientific and technical definitions</h3>

<p><lb>Units</lb>, <lb>physical</lb> <lb>quantities</lb>, <lb>formulas</lb>, etc In accordance with the recommendations of the International Standards Organization, all scientific measurements are expressed in si units (<i>Système International d’Unités</i>). Measurements and quantities in more traditional units are often given as well as si units. The entries for chemical compounds give the systematic names as well as the more familiar popular names.</p>

<p><lb>Plants and animals</lb>: When the scientific (Latin) names of phyla, divisions, classes, orders, families, genera, and species are used in definitions, they are printed in italic type and all except the specific name have an initial capital letter.</p>

<entry><hw>moss</hw> (<pron>mɒs</pron>) <posp>n</posp> <sense-num>1</sense-num> <def>any bryophyte of the phylum Bryophyta, typically growing in dense mats on trees ...</def></entry>

<h2 id="Cross-references">Cross-references</h2>

<p>The main entry is always given at the most common spelling or form of the word. Cross-reference entries refer to this main entry. Thus the entry for <xrhw>deoxyribonucleic acid</xrhw> cross-refers to <xrhw>DNA</xrhw>, where the full explanantion is given.</p>

<h3>Comparisons</h3>

<p>Cross-references introduced by the words ‘See also’ or ‘Compare’ refer the reader to additional information elsewhere in the Dictionary.<!-- If the crossreference is preceded by an empty arrow ▷, it applies to all senses of the headword that have gone before it, unless otherwise stated. If there is no empty arrow, the cross-reference applies only to the sense immediately preceding it.--></p>

<h3>Variant spellings</h3>

<p>Variant spellings (eg <xrhw>foetus</xrhw> ... a variant spelling of <xrhw>fetus</xrhw>) are generally entered as cross-references if their place in the alphabetical lists is more than ten entries distant from the main entry.</p>

<h3>Alternative names</h3>

<p>Alternative names or terms are printed in bold type and introduced by the words ‘Also’ or ‘Also called’.<!--If the alternative name or term is preceded by a coloured arrow (<blue>▶</blue>), it applies to the entire entry.--></p>

<h2 id="Related adjectives">Related adjectives</h2>

<p>Certain nouns, especially of Germanic origin, have related adjectives that are derived from Latin or French. For example, <xrhw>mural</xrhw> (from Latin) is an adjective related in meaning to <xrhw>wall</xrhw>. Such adjectives are shown in a number of cases after the sense (or part-of-speech block) to which they are related.</p>

<entry><hw>wall</hw> (<pron>wɔːl</pron>) <posp>n</posp> <sense-num>1</sense-num> <sense-num>a</sense-num> <def>a vertical construction made of stone, brick, wood, etc ... Related adjective: <xrhw>mural</xrhw> ...</def></entry>

<h2 id="Idioms">Idioms</h2>

<p>Fixed noun phrases, such as <xrhw>dark horse</xrhw>, and certain other idioms are given full headword status. Other idioms are placed under the key word of the idiom, as a separate sense, generally at the end of the appropriate part-of-speech block.</p>

<entry><hw>ground<sup>1</sup></hw> (<pron>ɡraʊnd</pron>) <posp>n</posp> <def>...</def> <sense-num>21</sense-num> <def><xrhw>break new ground</xrhw> to do something that has not been done before ...</def></entry>

<h2 id="Etymologies">Etymologies</h2>

<p>etymologies are indicated by the label <block-title>Word Origin</block-title> and appear after the definition. They are given for most headwords except those that are derivative forms (consisting of a base word and a suffix or prefix), compound words, inflected forms, and proper names. Many headwords, such as <xrhw>enlighten</xrhw> and <xrhw>prepossess</xrhw>, consist of a prefix and a base word and are not accompanied by etymologies since the essential etymological information is shown for the component parts, all of which are entered in the dictionary as headwords in their own right. The purpose of the etymologies is to trace briefly the history of the word back from the present day, through its first recorded appearance in English, to its origin, often in some source language other than English. The etymologies show the history of the word both in English (wherever there has been significant change in form or sense) and in its pre-English source languages. Words printed in <sc>small capitals</sc> refer to other headwords where relevant or additional information, either in the definition or in the etymology, may be found.</p>

<h3>Dating</h3>

<p>The etymology records the first known occurrence (a written citation) of a word in English. Words first appearing in the language during the Middle English period or later are dated by century, abbreviated C.</p>

<entry><hw>mantis</hw> (<pron>ˈmæntɪs</pron>) <posp>n</posp>, <posp>pl</posp> <infl>-tises</infl> or <infl>-tes</infl> <def>...</def> <block-title>Word Origin</block-title> <etym>C17: New Latin, from Greek: prophet, alluding to its praying posture</etym></entry>

<p>This indicates that there is a written citation for <xrhw>mantis</xrhw> in the seventeenth century. The absence of a New Latin or Greek form in the etymology means that the form of the word was the same in those languages as in English.</p>

<h3>Old English</h3>

<p>Native words from Old English are not dated, written records of Old English being scarce, but are simply identified as being of Old English origin.</p>

<h2 id="Subentries">Subentries</h2>

<h3>derived words</h3>

<p>Words derived from a base word by the addition of suffixes such as <i>-ly</i>, <i>-ness</i>, etc, may be entered in bold type immediately after the etymology or after the last definition if there is no etymology.</p>

<p>They are preceded by the symbol ›. The meanings of such words may be deduced from the meanings of the suffix and the headword.</p>

<h3>Compounds</h3>

<p>Subentries may also be compounds, words formed from two or more words or combining forms, the first of which will be the main entry headword or another of its subentries.</p>

<h3>Phrasal verbs</h3>

<p>Phrasal verbs (phrases consisting of a verb plus a particle) are usually given as subentries at the main entry for the constituent verb.</p>

<h3>Usage notes</h3>

<p>A brief note introduced by the label usage has been added after some entries in order to comment on matters of usage.</p>
